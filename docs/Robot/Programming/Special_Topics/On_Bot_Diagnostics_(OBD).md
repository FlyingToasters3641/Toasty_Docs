# On-Bot-Diagnostics (OBD)

## Why is OBD necessary
When an intake is impacted and detaches from the robot during a match or in practice, in most cases it is immediately obvious a problem occurred and approximately what went wrong via only visual observation. It is more challenging to detect faults occurring with the robot that are not visually apparent. When Sensors or wires fail or when mechanical wear occurs on a mechanism resulting in minute changes to performance, it may or may not be possible to determine these failures via visual inspection. Logging and On-Bot-Diagnostics can help detect these issues in an automated manner even when a traditional checklist or "eye test" may miss them.
