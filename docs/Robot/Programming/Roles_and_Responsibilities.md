# Programming Responsibilities and Roles

On an FRC team, programmers must fill many roles.

- Develop the logics that tells the robot systems how to move in a coordinated manner.
- Write the software that is ran on the robot
- Implement the Autonomous modes that the strategy team specifies
- Interprets various types of sensor data
- Reviews software and robot performance through the use of On Bot Diagnostics and signal logging
- etc...

## Real World Related Jobs in Software
### Software Engineering (SWE)
Writes the code that will be ran on the embedded electronic systems used to control all aspects of the robots motion and operation.

### Controls Design Engineering (CDE)
Responsible for coming up with the logic behind the software.

### Robot Calibration (Cal)
Responsible for tuning calibratable parameters built into the software to ensure smooth and controlled operation of the robot.

Example of items that the calibrator would be responsible for include:
- Tuning PID gains
- Adjusting shot map tables
- Tuning automated sequences to desired behavior
- Tuning Autonomous mode parameters
- Adjusts camera parameters for vision systems
