# Onshape

The main CAD application that is used to create 3d models for the flying toasters is "Onshape.com". Onshape was chosen for its collaboration capabilities. Many team members can work on a robots components at the same time while remaining continuously backed up and accessible from any device.

## Branches
Onshape also allows users to create branches in their projects. This allows for multiple users to work on different versions of the same project in parallel and then merge them together. This workflow is similar to GitHub.

## MKCAD App
The MKCAD app is an addon for onshape that enables users to import the majority of available COTS FRC specific parts and assemblies.
