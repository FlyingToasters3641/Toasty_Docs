## Retaining Rings
Retaining rings, also known to as snap rings, are used to secure items on a shaft axially. They come in both external and internal versions. For our applications we primarily use external retaining rings.

Common external retaining ring sizes are shown below.

| Shaft diameter | Inside Diameter | Thickness  |
| -------------- | --------------- | ---------- |
| TBD            | TBD             | TBD        |

## Specialized Fasteners
Sometimes it is necessary for us to use fasteners outside of the standard fasteners listed above.

### Carriage Bolts
Used in the construction of the bumpers of the flying toasters robots.
