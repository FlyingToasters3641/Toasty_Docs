# 3. Alliance Selection

!!! warning
    This page is a work in progress. After the conclusion of the qualification match each team must send a student representative down to the field to participate in the alliance selection process for the playoff tournament.

We must ensure that he student representative has the data and support that is necessary to ensure that the right picks are made to create the best alliance possible to fulfill our tournament objectives.

All of the data that has been collected via the scouters during the qualification matches is compiled into a database and  must be interpreted and compiled into a "picklist" that will be used to select the most capable and most compatible alliance partner for us to compete with during the playoff tournament.
