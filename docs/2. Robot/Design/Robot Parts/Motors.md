# FRC Legal Motors

## Overview

Each year there is an allowable motor list included in the challenges game manual. Teams must construct their robots using only motors included in the list. In FRC, typically their are brushless, brushed, servo, and linear motors available for team use. The list from the 2024 game manual is shown below.

!!! note
    As of the 2024 game manual, only four motors are permitted to transmit power to the carpet. (Typically through the drivetrain)
