# In the Stands

## Scouting

A crucial component of the teams operation at events is the scouting of the performance of all of the robots and driveteams on the field during a competition.

See Strategy for more details on the intricacies of the scouting system.

## Team Spirit

The stands are one of the primary publicly facing representations of the team at an event. While the drive team loads the robot onto the field to setup for a match, the team stands up and prepares to to cheer in support of the team whilst they are announced for the match.
